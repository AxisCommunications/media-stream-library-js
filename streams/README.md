Media Stream Library JS is an open-source JavaScript library to handle media
stream transforms for Node & the Web. The primary purpose is to deal with RTP
streams in a browser without the need to use plugins or Flash, but relying on
the [Media Source Extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/) standard,
which is supported in all modern browsers.

Although RTP streams is the main focus, the library is not limited to handling
RTP streams, or to the browser. It is suited to handle streams of messages of
any kind, and makes it easier to stitch together transformations from one message
type to another. Contributions of new components/pipelines are always welcome.

_Note for IE11 users_: there is a legacy build available on the `ie11` branch,
where the bundle `media-stream-library.legacy.min.js` can be found. Although we
don't support or test IE11, it should work. Note that the `ie11` branch is
maintenance only (dependencies will be kept up-to-date as much as possible).
You can also bundle it yourself and be aware that certain dependencies (e.g.
`debug`) have to be transpiled as they no longer ship es5 code. You can look at
the `webpack.legacy.config.js` to see how we build the legacy bundle. Since
IE11 is not supported or tested at all, you might run into different issues as
well. We welcome contributions keeping the legacy bundle working, as long as
it's limited to the webpack configuration.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node installed on your machine.
Then, to install the library:

```sh
npm install media-stream-library
```

## Usage

This library is not a full media player: the framework provides no video
controls, progress bar, or other features typically associated with a media
player. For a simple React-based player we refer to the [Media Stream
Player](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/media-stream-player-js) library,
which is built around this library.

However, getting video to play in the browser is quite easy (check the browser
example). There are currently no codecs included either, we rely on browser
support for that.

Although RTP streams is the main focus, the library is not limited to handling
RTP streams, or to the browser. Its main focus is to handle streams of messages,
and make it easier to stitch together transformations from one message type to
another. Contributions of new components/pipelines are always welcome.

### Importing

**script tag** You can directly include the `media-stream-library.min.js` file
(located in the package `dist` folder) in your browser (check the browser example):

```html
<script src="media-stream-library.min.js"></script>
```

in which case a global variable `mediaStreamLibrary` will exist that
contains all the necessary functions.

**bundler** Alternatively, you can import it into your javascript code if you
are going to bundle it yourself:

```js
import {components, pipelines} from 'media-stream-library';
```

Note that we expose entry points for both node and the browser. Any bundler
should be able to pick up the correct entry point from `package.json`. If not,
then you can try importing from `media-stream-library/dist/browser-esm`
instead. Since we no longer pre-bundle external dependencies, your bundler will
have to handle this. It might be that you need to replace references to
`global` with `window` because `readable-streams` (imported via
`stream-browserify`) still refers to `global`.

### Components and pipelines

The library contains a collection of components that can be connected together
to form media pipelines. The components are a low-level abstraction on top of
Node streams to allow two-way communication, while media pipelines are sets of
connected components with methods that allow you to control the pipeline, and
easily add/remove components.

Components can be categorized as:

- sources (socket, file, ...)
- transforms (parsers, depay, muxers, ...)
- sinks (HTML5 element, file, ...)

To build a pipeline, you can connect the required components. A number of common
pipelines are exported directly for convenience.

Check the `examples` section to see how these can be used in your own code. To
run the examples yourself, you'll need to clone this repository loccally and
follow the developer instructions.

## Debugging

In the browser, you can set `localStorage.debug = 'msl:*'` to log everything
related to just this library (make sure to reload the page after setting the
value).
