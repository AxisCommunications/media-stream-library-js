/**
 * Component
 *
 * A component is a set of bi-directional streams consisting of an 'incoming'
 * and 'outgoing' stream.
 *
 * They contain references to other components so they can form a linked list of
 * components, i.e. a pipeline. When linking components, the incoming and
 * outgoing streams are piped, so that data flowing through the incoming stream
 * is transfered to the next component, and data in the outgoing stream flows
 * to the previous component.
 *
 * Components at the end of such a pipeline typically connect the incoming and
 * outgoing streams to a data source or data sink.
 *
 * Typically, for a component that is connected to two other components, both
 * incoming and outgoing will be Transform streams. For a source, 'incoming'
 * will be a Readable stream and 'outgoing' a Writable stream, while for a sink
 * it is reversed. Both source and sink could also use a single Duplex stream,
 * with incoming === outgoing.
