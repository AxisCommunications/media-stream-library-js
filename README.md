# Media streams and overlay

This repository hosts 3 different libraries used for playback
of video streams and enabling simpler SVG overlays.

For development, you'll need a local installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
and [yarn](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies.
To run commands, you need [just](https://just.systems/), which can be installed using
[prebuilt binaries](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_5.html#pre-built-binaries) or
[yarn](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_8.html#nodejs-installation), e.g.
`yarn global add just-install`.
